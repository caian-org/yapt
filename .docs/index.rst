An opinionated template for Python projects that includes, out of the
box:

-  Unit testing with **pytest**
-  Type checking with **MyPy**
-  Code coverage on **Codecov**
-  **Docker** image
-  Good-looking API documentation with **Sphinx**
-  CI/CD pipeline on **GitHub Actions** with:

   -  Linting, typing and style checking
   -  Test execution and coverage report upload
   -  Docker image push to DockerHub


-------------
Compatibility
-------------

``yapt`` is tested against all major python versions: ``3.6``, ``3.7``,
``3.8``, ``3.9`` and ``3.10``.
